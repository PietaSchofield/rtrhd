Description: This is a collection of convenience functions generally for turning routinely collected
  health care data from sources like CPRD into duckdb databases to enable SQL based filtering and selection
  for downstream analysis in R. It also has some tools for importing NHSBSA DM Plus D xml files into a
  duckdb and for importing SNOMED CT files into a duckdb as well as manipulation CPRD denominator and
  linkage files to generate control cohorts (but these are possibly too project specific to be generalise)
